      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Baseline Model Evaluation task into granular subtasks covering framework setup, metric implementation, evaluators for each task type, visualization, error analysis, documentation, integration, transfer learning analysis, Lightning.AI Studio setup, TorchMetrics integration, automated job submission, and Qwen3-4B-specific configurations (thinking mode, English-only tokens). Ensure each subtask is actionable and can be assigned independently.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing and implementing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline for a large language model (Qwen3-4B) with multiple metrics, modes (thinking/non-thinking), and integration with Lightning.AI Studios. It involves distributed evaluation, experiment tracking, error analysis, and specialized configuration for both the model and the evaluation environment. The breadth of requirements, technical depth, and need for robust documentation and modularity make this a high-complexity task. The existing breakdown into 15 subtasks is appropriate, as each covers a distinct aspect of the evaluation process and supports parallel development."

Each subtask should be focused and independently actionable.",
      "reasoning": "This task encompasses the design and implementation of a flexible, scalable hyperparameter tuning system with advanced experiment tracking, transfer learning analysis, and deep integration with Lightning.AI Studios and Weights & Biases. It requires robust configuration management, distributed job orchestration, and specialized analysis for both spelling and transfer learning metrics. The technical scope, need for extensibility, and integration with multiple external systems justify a very high complexity score. The 13 recommended subtasks reflect the need to modularize the work across configuration, execution, analysis, and integration domains."

Ensure each subtask addresses a specific technical or operational requirement for optimized fine-tuning in a cloud GPU environment.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating Unsloth for memory-efficient fine-tuning of a large model in a cloud environment is technically demanding. It involves environment configuration, advanced model loading, dataset and tokenization handling, dual-mode evaluation, and robust reporting/monitoring. The need to support both spelling and transfer tasks, handle English-only tokens, and operate efficiently on cloud GPUs increases complexity. Eleven subtasks are justified to address the distinct technical challenges and ensure maintainability."

      "reasoning": "This task covers the end-to-end training, experimentation, and deployment of a large language model with a focus on transfer learning. It requires robust scripting, experiment management, cloud resource orchestration, and advanced evaluation/reporting. The need to support multiple modes, hyperparameter sweeps, and integration with deployment and monitoring systems makes this a highly complex, multi-faceted task. Eleven subtasks are recommended to ensure each major component is addressed in depth."

      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task, requiring a full evaluation suite for a fine-tuned LLM across multiple metrics, modes, and token subsets, with deep integration into Lightning.AI Studios. It involves advanced analytics, visualization, error analysis, cost/resource optimization, and extensive documentation. The breadth and depth of requirements, as well as the need for reproducibility and scalability, justify the maximum complexity score and a large number of subtasks to cover all aspects of the evaluation lifecycle."

      "reasoning": "Publishing a model with comprehensive documentation, including Hugging Face integration, API/deployment/monitoring guides, and mode-specific explanations, is a multi-dimensional task. It requires technical accuracy, clarity, and completeness across several documentation and publishing domains. Thirteen subtasks are appropriate to ensure each documentation and publishing requirement is addressed thoroughly."
