For each subtask, provide clear dependencies, acceptance criteria, and implementation details.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive evaluation framework with multiple metrics, implementing specific evaluators for different question types, setting up visualization and reporting systems, and ensuring proper integration with other components. The implementation details show significant complexity with data processing, model inference, metrics calculation, and visualization requirements. The existing 8 subtasks are well-structured but could benefit from more detailed acceptance criteria."

For each subtask, specify clear dependencies, implementation details, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building a sophisticated infrastructure for hyperparameter experimentation with multiple components: configuration management, integration with W&B, grid/random search implementation, experiment execution, results analysis, and visualization. The code shows complex functionality for creating, managing, and executing experiments. The current 7 subtasks appropriately cover the main components needed for this infrastructure."

For each subtask, specify cloud environment requirements, dependencies, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex GPU optimization techniques, integration with specialized libraries (Unsloth), memory-efficient training configurations, and cloud environment setup. It requires deep understanding of model quantization, GPU memory management, and efficient training pipelines. The task has strict hardware requirements (cloud GPU) and involves multiple optimization techniques. The existing 6 subtasks appropriately cover the key components needed."

For each subtask, specify cloud GPU requirements, dependencies, implementation details, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task in the project, involving actual model training with multiple hyperparameter configurations, checkpoint management, cloud GPU environment setup, and comprehensive results analysis. It requires integration with all previous components (evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, Unsloth) and involves running resource-intensive experiments. The task also includes deployment components for model serving. The existing 7 subtasks appropriately cover the main components."

For each subtask, specify dependencies, implementation details, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves developing a sophisticated evaluation system with multiple metrics, detailed error analysis, visualization components, and comprehensive reporting. It requires integration with previous components and careful analysis of model performance. The implementation details show complex metrics calculations, error categorization, and visualization requirements. The existing 8 subtasks provide good coverage of the necessary components."

For each subtask, specify dependencies, deliverables, and verification criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on documentation and publishing rather than technical implementation, but still requires careful attention to detail across multiple documentation types and publishing platforms. It involves creating comprehensive documentation for different audiences (users, developers, operations) and publishing the model to Hugging Face with proper metadata. The existing 8 subtasks appropriately cover the different documentation and publishing requirements."
