For each subtask, provide detailed steps, dependencies, and validation criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components including package management with a newer tool (uv), setting up external services (W&B, Hugging Face), and creating a reproducible environment. The existing 4 subtasks are a good start but could be expanded to better separate concerns. The complexity is moderate (6/10) as it requires technical knowledge across multiple domains but follows standard patterns."

For each subtask, include specific implementation details, validation criteria, and potential edge cases to handle.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves working with the GPT-2 tokenizer, applying specific filtering criteria, and saving the results in a structured format. The existing 3 subtasks (Script Writing, Validation & Testing, Documentation) are logical but could be reorganized to better separate the technical concerns. The complexity is moderate (5/10) as it requires understanding of tokenizers but has a clear implementation path with provided code."

For each subtask, specify input/output requirements, validation criteria, and potential challenges.",

The existing 7 subtasks are well-structured but could benefit from more specific focus on the different question types and validation processes. The source-based split approach adds complexity that requires careful implementation."

The complexity is high (7/10) due to the need for creative template design and ensuring proper formatting for model training. Currently there are no subtasks defined, but the task would benefit from being broken down to handle the different aspects of template creation and data formatting separately."
