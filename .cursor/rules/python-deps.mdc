- **Always Use `uv` for Python Package Management**
  - Use `uv` instead of `pip` for all Python package operations
  - `uv` is significantly faster and more reliable than pip
  - Ensures consistent dependency resolution

- **Installation Commands**
  ```bash
  # ✅ DO: Use uv for installations
  uv pip install package_name
  uv pip install -r requirements.txt

  # ❌ DON'T: Use pip directly
  pip install package_name  # Too slow
  pip install -r requirements.txt  # Less reliable
  ```

- **Virtual Environment Management**
  ```bash
  # ✅ DO: Use uv for venv creation
  uv venv

  # ❌ DON'T: Use other tools
  python -m venv .venv  # Less efficient
  virtualenv .venv  # Not as fast
  ```

- **Requirements File Updates**
  ```bash
  # ✅ DO: Use uv to compile requirements
  uv pip compile requirements.txt

  # ❌ DON'T: Use pip freeze
  pip freeze > requirements.txt  # Less deterministic
  ```

- **Key Benefits**
  - Up to 10x faster than pip
  - More reliable dependency resolution
  - Better caching and parallel downloads
  - Improved security with modern package verification

- **Installation**
  - Install uv globally: `brew install uv`
  - Verify installation: `uv --version`
