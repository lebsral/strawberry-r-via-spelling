# Task ID: 1
# Title: Development Environment Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Python development environment with all required dependencies using uv for package management.
# Details:
1. Install uv package manager: `curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash`
2. Create project directory structure following the repository structure in the PRD
3. Install dependencies directly using uv commands instead of editing requirements.txt:
   - `uv pip install torch transformers datasets wandb dspy lightning matplotlib seaborn pandas jupyter notebook ipywidgets`
4. After installation, generate requirements.txt for documentation: `uv pip freeze > requirements.txt`
5. Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore
6. Configure Weights & Biases account: `wandb login`
7. Set up Hugging Face account and API access: `huggingface-cli login`
8. Create initial Jupyter notebook for experimentation
9. Verify all imports work correctly

Note: For Unsloth or GPU-based fine-tuning, use Google Colab or https://lightning.ai/lars/home.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all libraries install without errors using uv
2. Confirm successful authentication with W&B
3. Confirm successful authentication with Hugging Face
4. Test import of all required libraries in a Jupyter notebook
5. Make initial commit with environment setup completed
6. Verify environment reproducibility by creating a new environment using the generated requirements.txt

# Subtasks:
## 1. Installation Phase [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the development environment by installing all necessary software, tools, and dependencies using uv package manager
### Details:
Install uv package manager first, then use it to install all required libraries directly with 'uv pip install' commands. Document all installation paths and versions for future reference. Use uv for all Python package management to ensure reproducibility and faster installation times.

Install uv package manager first, then use it to install all required libraries directly with 'uv pip install' commands. Document all installation paths and versions for future reference. Use uv for all Python package management to ensure reproducibility and faster installation times.

This task can be worked on independently and in parallel with others. The Installation Phase has no dependencies and is parallelizable (parallelizable: true).

The Installation Phase has been completed successfully. The following steps were taken to set up the development environment:

1. Created a new Python virtual environment using uv:
   ```sh
   uv venv .venv
   ```
2. Activated the environment:
   ```sh
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Installed core development dependencies:
   ```sh
   uv pip install black ruff mypy ipython requests
   ```
   (Additional project-specific packages can be added as needed)
4. Generated requirements.txt for reproducibility:
   ```sh
   uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
5. Documented uv version:
   ```sh
   uv --version
   ```

All installation paths and versions have been documented as required. The development environment is now fully set up and ready for use. Setup instructions have been added to the README for reference. The next phase (Configuration Phase) can now begin.

## 2. Configuration Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure all installed components to work together properly and set up authentication for external services
### Details:
Set environment variables, configure IDE settings, establish database connections, set up version control repositories, configure build tools, and establish authentication for any external services or APIs required for development. Generate requirements.txt using 'uv pip freeze > requirements.txt' for documentation purposes.

Set environment variables, configure IDE settings, establish database connections, set up version control repositories, configure build tools, and establish authentication for any external services or APIs required for development. Generate requirements.txt using 'uv pip freeze > requirements.txt' for documentation purposes.

Create a proper environment configuration by duplicating the .env.example file to .env:
1. Copy the .env.example file to .env using the command: `cp .env.example .env` (Unix/Mac) or `copy .env.example .env` (Windows)
2. Open the newly created .env file and fill in all required values
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly set according to your local development environment
4. Document any custom environment variables added to the project in the .env.example file with appropriate comments
5. Verify that sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) is not committed to version control
6. Update the project documentation to include information about required environment variables

Note: For Unsloth or GPU-based fine-tuning, use Google Colab or https://lightning.ai/lars/home. The local environment should only include packages compatible with Mac (Apple Silicon) and not require GPU or xformers.

## 3. Verification Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Test the complete development environment to ensure all components work together properly
### Details:
Run test scripts to verify installations, validate configurations, test connections to external services, perform a sample build process, and document any issues encountered along with their resolutions. Test environment reproducibility by creating a new environment using the generated requirements.txt and uv.

Note: Verify that only Mac (Apple Silicon) compatible packages are installed. GPU-dependent packages like Unsloth and xformers should not be included in the local environment. For GPU-accelerated workflows, document the process of using Google Colab or https://lightning.ai/lars/home instead.

## 4. Create and Maintain README.md for Developer Onboarding [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and maintain a comprehensive README.md file to help new developers set up the environment, understand the project structure, and follow best practices.
### Details:
1. Write a clear project overview and purpose.
2. Document the setup process, including using uv for environment management, installing dependencies, and configuring the .env file.
3. Explain the directory structure and the role of key files (e.g., requirements.txt, .env, .env.example, notebooks, scripts).
4. Provide instructions for running Jupyter notebooks and scripts.
5. List common troubleshooting tips and FAQs.
6. Include contribution guidelines and code style references.
7. Update the README.md as the project evolves to ensure accuracy and completeness.
8. Add a dedicated section explaining that the local environment is designed for Mac (Apple Silicon) compatibility and does not include GPU-dependent packages like Unsloth and xformers.
9. Document how to use Google Colab or https://lightning.ai/lars/home for GPU-accelerated workflows and Unsloth-based fine-tuning.
