# GPT-2 Spelling Fine-tuned Model with Transfer Learning

This model is a fine-tuned version of [gpt2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) on spelling tasks, demonstrating transfer learning to letter count and position tasks. It was fine-tuned using LoRA adapters to improve the model's understanding of letter count and character position via spelling mechanics.

## Model description

This model was fine-tuned to address the "strawberry problem" - improving a language model's ability to answer questions about letter counts and positions in words without explicitly training on those tasks. Instead, the model was trained on spelling tasks, which implicitly teaches it to understand character-level patterns, demonstrating effective transfer learning.

### Training hyperparameters

- LoRA rank (r): {config['lora_config']['r']}
- LoRA alpha: {config['lora_config']['alpha']}
- Learning rate: {config['training_config']['learning_rate']}
- Batch size: {config['training_config']['per_device_train_batch_size']}
- Gradient accumulation steps: {config['training_config']['gradient_accumulation_steps']}
- Training steps: {config['training_config']['max_steps']}

## Evaluation results

### Base model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}
- Character-Level Accuracy: {base_metrics['character_level_accuracy']:.4f}
- Normalized Levenshtein Distance: {base_metrics['levenshtein_distance']:.4f}

### Fine-tuned model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}
- Character-Level Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['character_level_accuracy']:.4f}
- Normalized Levenshtein Distance: {finetuned_metrics['levenshtein_distance']:.4f}

### Improvements
- Letter Count Accuracy: {improvements['letter_count_accuracy']:.2f}%
- Letter Position Accuracy: {improvements['letter_position_accuracy']:.2f}%
- Character-Level Accuracy: {improvements['character_level_accuracy']:.2f}%
- Normalized Levenshtein Distance: {improvements['levenshtein_distance']:.2f}%

## Usage

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("YOUR-USERNAME/gpt2-spelling-lora")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("YOUR-USERNAME/gpt2-spelling-lora")

# Example questions for position/count evaluation
questions = [
    "How many r's are in the word 'strawberry'?",
    "What is the 3rd letter in 'strawberry'?"
]

# Generate answers
for question in questions:
    inputs = tokenizer(question, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=50)
    answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}\n")
    
# Example for spelling tasks
spelling_prompts = [
    "Spell the word 'strawberry':",
    "How do you spell 'algorithm'?"
]

for prompt in spelling_prompts:
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=50)
    answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"Response: {answer}\n")
```

## Training procedure

### Training data

The model was trained on a dataset of spelling examples generated from GPT-2 tokens. The training data included various template formats for spelling examples to maximize generalization.

The validation and test sets were created from English dictionary words that were not in the training set, ensuring proper evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to new words.

### Transfer learning approach

This model demonstrates transfer learning by training on spelling tasks and evaluating on letter count and position tasks. The hypothesis is that by learning to spell words correctly, the model implicitly develops an understanding of character-level patterns that transfers to related tasks.

### Training method

The model was fine-tuned using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with Unsloth optimizations. This approach allows for efficient fine-tuning with minimal memory requirements while maintaining performance.

## Limitations and bias

This model is specifically fine-tuned for spelling tasks with transfer learning to letter count and position tasks. It may not perform well on other tasks. It is also limited by the vocabulary of the base GPT-2 model and may struggle with rare or complex words.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the "strawberry problem" in language models - improving a model's ability to answer questions about letter counts and positions in words without explicitly training on those tasks. Instead, the model is trained on spelling tasks, which implicitly teaches it to understand character-level patterns, demonstrating effective transfer learning.

## Approach

We fine-tuned a GPT-2 language model using LoRA adapters with the following approach:

1. Extracted multi-character, letter-based tokens from the GPT-2 tokenizer vocabulary
2. Created a dataset of spelling examples with various template formats
3. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
4. Fine-tuned the model using Unsloth optimizations
5. Evaluated the model on both spelling tasks and letter count/position tasks

## Results

### Base model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}

### Fine-tuned model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}

## Overview

This guide describes how to monitor the deployed spelling model API using Prometheus and Grafana, with a focus on tracking transfer learning metrics.

## Metrics Collection

### Prometheus Configuration

The API exposes metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format. Configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics by adding the following to your `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spelling-model-api'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['spelling-model-api:8000']
```

A complete Prometheus configuration is available at `deployment/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

## Dashboards

### Grafana Setup

1. Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana
2. Import the pre-built dashboards from `deployment/monitoring/grafana/`

### Available Dashboards

- **API Overview**: General API metrics (request rate, latency, errors)
- **Model Performance**: Inference time, batch size, memory usage
- **System Resources**: CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Transfer Learning**: Metrics comparing spelling vs. position/count performance

### Transfer Learning Dashboard

The Transfer Learning dashboard includes:

- Correlation between spelling accuracy and position/count accuracy
- Performance comparison between task types
- Transfer efficiency metrics over time
- Real-world usage patterns showing transfer learning effectiveness

## Alerting

### Alert Rules

- High error rate (>5% of requests)
- High latency (p95 > 500ms)
- Resource constraints (CPU > 80%, memory > 80%)
- Transfer learning degradation (correlation < 0.7)
- Task-specific performance drops

### Alert Configuration

To configure alerts with Alertmanager:

1. Deploy Alertmanager using the configuration in `deployment/monitoring/alertmanager/`
2. Configure notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
3. Apply the alert rules

## Logging

Logs are output in JSON format and can be collected using Fluentd, Logstash, or similar tools.

Key log fields:
- `timestamp`: Log timestamp
- `level`: Log level (info, warning, error)
- `message`: Log message
- `request_id`: Unique ID for request tracing
- `component`: Component generating the log
- `task_type`: Type of task (spelling or position_count)
- `transfer_metrics`: Transfer learning metrics when applicable

## Tracing

The API supports distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry. Configure your tracing backend (Jaeger, Zipkin) using the environment variables in `deployment/env/`.

## Transfer Learning Analysis

To analyze transfer learning patterns in production:

1. Enable the transfer learning metrics collection in the API
2. Use the provided Jupyter notebook at `notebooks/transfer_learning_analysis.ipynb`
3. Connect the notebook to your Prometheus data source
4. Run the analysis to visualize transfer learning patterns over time

## 3. Hugging Face Model Publishing and Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Publish the model to Hugging Face Hub and verify its functionality
### Details:
Use the huggingface_hub library to upload the model, tokenizer, and model card. Configure model tags, set appropriate visibility settings, and verify the model card renders correctly. Test the uploaded model with sample inference code to ensure it works as expected. Validate that all metadata is correctly displayed on the model page and that links to datasets are functional.

NOTE: If publishing Unsloth or GPU-fine-tuned models, use a cloud GPU environment (Google Colab or https://lightning.ai/lars/home). Local publishing is only for CPU-compatible models.

## 4. Final Report Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive report summarizing the model development, performance, and publication process
### Details:
Generate a final report documenting the entire model development lifecycle. Include: executive summary, methodology, training process details, evaluation metrics with visualizations, comparison to baseline models, limitations discovered during testing, deployment considerations, and future improvement recommendations. Format as a professional document with proper citations and appendices for detailed results.

## 5. Cloud Environment Setup for Model Publishing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure cloud GPU environment for publishing Unsloth or GPU-fine-tuned models
### Details:
Set up a cloud GPU environment (Google Colab or https://lightning.ai/lars/home) for publishing models that require GPU resources. Create a notebook or script that handles authentication with Hugging Face, loads the model from local storage or cloud storage, and publishes it to the Hugging Face Hub. Include clear instructions for users on how to use this environment for model publishing. Test the workflow to ensure it works seamlessly with Unsloth-optimized models.

## 6. API Documentation Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create detailed API documentation for model inference endpoints
### Details:
Develop comprehensive API documentation in `docs/api.md` that includes:
- Endpoint descriptions and usage examples
- Request/response formats with JSON examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling and status codes
- Rate limiting information
- Performance considerations

Ensure documentation matches the actual implementation in `src/api/app.py` and `src/api/routes/`.

## 7. Deployment Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create deployment guide for Docker and Kubernetes environments
### Details:
Develop a detailed deployment guide in `docs/deployment.md` covering:
- Docker deployment instructions
- Kubernetes deployment configuration
- Environment variable configuration
- Resource requirements and scaling recommendations
- Security considerations

Reference the actual configuration files in `deployment/docker-compose.yml` and `deployment/k8s/`.

## 8. Monitoring Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create monitoring guide for Prometheus and Grafana setup
### Details:
Develop a monitoring guide in `docs/monitoring.md` that includes:
- Prometheus configuration for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboard setup and import instructions
- Alert configuration with Alertmanager
- Log collection and analysis recommendations
- Performance monitoring best practices

Reference the actual configuration files in `deployment/monitoring/`.

## 9. Transfer Learning Documentation and Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.6, 10.8
### Description: Document the transfer learning approach and implement metrics tracking
### Details:

- Update model card to highlight transfer learning aspects
- Document correlation between spelling performance and position/count performance
- Create visualization tools for transfer learning metrics
- Implement monitoring for transfer learning effectiveness in production
- Add transfer learning analysis to the final report

Ensure all documentation clearly explains how training on spelling tasks transfers to position/count tasks.

## 10. Dual-Task API Implementation Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Document the implementation of separate endpoints for spelling and position/count tasks
### Details:
Create detailed documentation for the dual-task API implementation:
- Document the separate endpoints for spelling training and position/count evaluation
- Provide examples for both task types
- Explain how to configure the API for different task types
- Document error handling specific to each task type
- Include performance considerations for both tasks

Ensure the documentation covers how to efficiently use both capabilities of the model.
