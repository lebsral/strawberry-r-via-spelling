# GPT-2 Spelling Fine-tuned Model

This model is a fine-tuned version of [gpt2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) on spelling tasks. It was fine-tuned using LoRA adapters to improve the model's understanding of letter count and character position via spelling mechanics.

## Model description

This model was fine-tuned to address the "strawberry problem" - improving a language model's ability to answer questions about letter counts and positions in words without explicitly training on those tasks. Instead, the model was trained on spelling tasks, which implicitly teaches it to understand character-level patterns.

### Training hyperparameters

- LoRA rank (r): {config['lora_config']['r']}
- LoRA alpha: {config['lora_config']['alpha']}
- Learning rate: {config['training_config']['learning_rate']}
- Batch size: {config['training_config']['per_device_train_batch_size']}
- Gradient accumulation steps: {config['training_config']['gradient_accumulation_steps']}
- Training steps: {config['training_config']['max_steps']}

## Evaluation results

### Base model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}
- Character-Level Accuracy: {base_metrics['character_level_accuracy']:.4f}
- Normalized Levenshtein Distance: {base_metrics['levenshtein_distance']:.4f}

### Fine-tuned model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}
- Character-Level Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['character_level_accuracy']:.4f}
- Normalized Levenshtein Distance: {finetuned_metrics['levenshtein_distance']:.4f}

### Improvements
- Letter Count Accuracy: {improvements['letter_count_accuracy']:.2f}%
- Letter Position Accuracy: {improvements['letter_position_accuracy']:.2f}%
- Character-Level Accuracy: {improvements['character_level_accuracy']:.2f}%
- Normalized Levenshtein Distance: {improvements['levenshtein_distance']:.2f}%

## Usage

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("YOUR-USERNAME/gpt2-spelling-lora")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("YOUR-USERNAME/gpt2-spelling-lora")

# Example questions
questions = [
    "How many r's are in the word 'strawberry'?",
    "What is the 3rd letter in 'strawberry'?"
]

# Generate answers
for question in questions:
    inputs = tokenizer(question, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=50)
    answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}\n")
```

## Training procedure

### Training data

The model was trained on a dataset of spelling examples generated from GPT-2 tokens. The training data included various template formats for spelling examples to maximize generalization.

The validation and test sets were created from English dictionary words that were not in the training set, ensuring proper evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to new words.

### Training method

The model was fine-tuned using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with Unsloth optimizations. This approach allows for efficient fine-tuning with minimal memory requirements while maintaining performance.

## Limitations and bias

This model is specifically fine-tuned for spelling tasks and may not perform well on other tasks. It is also limited by the vocabulary of the base GPT-2 model and may struggle with rare or complex words.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the "strawberry problem" in language models - improving a model's ability to answer questions about letter counts and positions in words without explicitly training on those tasks. Instead, the model is trained on spelling tasks, which implicitly teaches it to understand character-level patterns.

## Approach

We fine-tuned a GPT-2 language model using LoRA adapters with the following approach:

1. Extracted multi-character, letter-based tokens from the GPT-2 tokenizer vocabulary
2. Created a dataset of spelling examples with various template formats
3. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
4. Fine-tuned the model using Unsloth optimizations
5. Evaluated the model on letter count and position tasks

## Results

### Base model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {base_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}

### Fine-tuned model performance
- Letter Count Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_count_accuracy']:.4f}
- Letter Position Accuracy: {finetuned_metrics['letter_position_accuracy']:.4f}
