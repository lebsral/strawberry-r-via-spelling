# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize and Fine-Tune Lightning.AI Studios for Performance, Cost, and Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the Lightning.AI Studios setup for maximum performance, efficient GPU usage, cost management, and maintainability, while implementing best practices for organization, monitoring, and future scalability, with specific focus on Qwen3-4B model requirements.
# Details:
Review the current Lightning.AI Studios configuration post-migration (from Task 12) and identify bottlenecks in data loading, model training, and evaluation workflows. Implement dataset optimizations to minimize GPU idle time and reduce cloud costs by ensuring fast data transfer and leveraging Lightning's optimize operator where appropriate[1][2]. Adjust GPU allocation and sleep settings to balance performance with cost efficiency, using Lightning's built-in controls and best practices. Organize Studios and components following Lightning.AI's recommended structure for clarity and maintainability[3]. Set up comprehensive monitoring tools tailored for Qwen3-4B's specific requirements, including monitoring for both thinking and non-thinking modes, English-only token filtering performance, and sampling parameter effectiveness (Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, MinP=0). Establish automated alerts for resource usage anomalies and mode-specific issues. Document and automate regular maintenance procedures, including dependency updates and Studio health checks. Plan for future scaling by enabling multi-GPU support, low-precision training, and efficient configuration management using YAML recipes and parameter-efficient finetuning methods[5].

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all Studios demonstrate improved performance by benchmarking training and evaluation times before and after optimization. Confirm reduced GPU idle time and lower cloud costs through resource usage reports. Ensure GPU sleep settings are correctly applied and tested for both cost savings and rapid wake-up. Review Studio organization for adherence to best practices and clarity. Validate that monitoring dashboards are operational for both thinking and non-thinking modes, with specific metrics for token filtering performance, sampling parameter effectiveness, and mode-specific performance. Test that alerts trigger appropriately for mode-specific issues. Verify comprehensive logging is implemented for both modes. Test latency monitoring for mode switching and cache effectiveness tracking. Validate maintenance scripts and procedures for reliability. Simulate scaling scenarios (e.g., multi-GPU, larger datasets) to confirm readiness for future growth.
