# Task ID: 12
# Title: Migrate Evaluation Framework Components to Lightning.AI Studios
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate all core evaluation framework components—including data preparation scripts, training workflows, and evaluation systems—into their respective Lightning.AI Studios, ensuring full functionality and leveraging Lightning.AI features.
# Details:
Begin by auditing existing data preparation, training, and evaluation components to identify dependencies and required resources. For each component, refactor code and workflows as needed to fit Lightning.AI Studio paradigms, such as modular Studio apps. Migrate data preparation scripts into a dedicated Studio, ensuring compatibility with Lightning.AI's persistent storage for datasets and intermediate results. Move training workflows into Studios that utilize GPU switching, configuring resource allocation and environment variables for optimal performance. Transition evaluation systems into Studios, integrating with the plugin system for extensibility and automation. Throughout migration, maintain existing functionality and adapt interfaces to Lightning.AI's UI/UX standards. Document all changes, update configuration files, and ensure seamless integration between Studios. Address any deprecated or incompatible features by leveraging Lightning.AI alternatives or plugins. Ensure all implementations strictly adhere to the project policy of using only Qwen3 non-thinking mode (enable_thinking=False), with no references to thinking mode in any code, configuration, or documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that each migrated component (data preparation, training, evaluation) runs successfully within its respective Lightning.AI Studio, producing expected outputs. Test GPU switching by running training workflows on different GPU types and confirming correct resource usage. Validate persistent storage by saving and retrieving datasets and intermediate results across Studio sessions. Assess plugin integration by installing and running at least one relevant plugin in the evaluation Studio. Perform end-to-end tests to ensure the entire workflow—from data preparation through evaluation—operates as intended. Compare results with pre-migration outputs to confirm parity. Review documentation for completeness and accuracy. Verify that all Qwen3 implementations have enable_thinking=False and that no thinking mode functionality is present in any code or configuration.

# Subtasks:

### Description: Transition training workflows into Lightning.AI Studios, implementing GPU switching, configuring resource allocation, and setting environment variables for optimal performance.
### Details:
Refactor training code to leverage Lightning.AI's resource management features, ensure compatibility with Studio paradigms, and document environment configurations. Ensure all Qwen3 implementations explicitly set enable_thinking=False and remove any thinking mode-specific code paths.

## 4. Migrate and Integrate Evaluation Systems with Plugin Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Move evaluation systems into Lightning.AI Studios, integrating with the plugin system for extensibility and automation, and adapting interfaces to Lightning.AI's UI/UX standards.
### Details:
Refactor evaluation logic as modular Studio apps, implement plugin hooks, and update UI components for seamless user experience. Ensure evaluation metrics and systems are optimized for non-thinking mode only, removing any thinking mode-specific evaluation criteria.

## 5. System Integration, Testing, and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Ensure seamless integration between all migrated Studios, address deprecated or incompatible features, and document all changes and updated configurations.
### Details:
Conduct system-wide integration tests, resolve any migration issues, and update technical documentation and configuration files. Ensure all documentation clearly states that only Qwen3 non-thinking mode is supported and remove any references to thinking mode functionality.

## 6. Implement Qwen3-4B Non-Thinking Mode Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Optimize Qwen3-4B non-thinking mode within the Lightning.AI Studios framework.
### Details:
Develop and implement optimizations specifically for Qwen3-4B non-thinking mode (enable_thinking=False). Configure resource allocation optimization for non-thinking mode. Implement performance monitoring systems to track efficiency metrics for non-thinking mode operation.

## 7. Implement English-Only Token Filtering for Qwen3-4B [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop and integrate efficient English-only token filtering for Qwen3-4B within the Lightning.AI Studios environment.
### Details:
Design and implement memory-optimized token filtering algorithms for English-only subset. Develop efficient error handling mechanisms for token filtering edge cases. Optimize tokenizer performance specifically for the English-only subset.

## 8. Optimize Sampling Parameters for Qwen3-4B [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Configure and optimize sampling parameter settings (Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, TopK=20, MinP=0) for Qwen3-4B in Lightning.AI Studios.
### Details:
Implement the specified sampling parameter configurations. Develop efficient batch processing mechanisms that maintain optimal sampling parameters for non-thinking mode operation. Ensure all configurations explicitly set enable_thinking=False.

## 9. Implement Caching Strategies for Qwen3-4B [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Design and implement efficient caching strategies for Qwen3-4B non-thinking mode.
### Details:
Develop caching mechanisms optimized for non-thinking mode usage patterns. Optimize model loading and initialization processes to leverage caching for faster startup times. Ensure all cached configurations maintain enable_thinking=False.

## 10. Remove Thinking Mode References from Codebase [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Systematically identify and remove all references to Qwen3 thinking mode throughout the codebase and documentation.
### Details:
Conduct a comprehensive search for any references to thinking mode, <think> blocks, or enable_thinking parameter. Remove or refactor all identified code, ensuring non-thinking mode is the only supported configuration. Update all documentation to reflect the project policy of using only non-thinking mode.
