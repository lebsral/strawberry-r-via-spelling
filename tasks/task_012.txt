# Task ID: 12
# Title: Migrate Evaluation Framework Components to Lightning.AI Studios
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate all core evaluation framework components—including data preparation scripts, training workflows, and evaluation systems—into their respective Lightning.AI Studios, ensuring full functionality and leveraging Lightning.AI features.
# Details:
Begin by auditing existing data preparation, training, and evaluation components to identify dependencies and required resources. For each component, refactor code and workflows as needed to fit Lightning.AI Studio paradigms, such as modular Studio apps. Migrate data preparation scripts into a dedicated Studio, ensuring compatibility with Lightning.AI's persistent storage for datasets and intermediate results. Move training workflows into Studios that utilize GPU switching, configuring resource allocation and environment variables for optimal performance. Transition evaluation systems into Studios, integrating with the plugin system for extensibility and automation. Throughout migration, maintain existing functionality and adapt interfaces to Lightning.AI's UI/UX standards. Document all changes, update configuration files, and ensure seamless integration between Studios. Address any deprecated or incompatible features by leveraging Lightning.AI alternatives or plugins.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that each migrated component (data preparation, training, evaluation) runs successfully within its respective Lightning.AI Studio, producing expected outputs. Test GPU switching by running training workflows on different GPU types and confirming correct resource usage. Validate persistent storage by saving and retrieving datasets and intermediate results across Studio sessions. Assess plugin integration by installing and running at least one relevant plugin in the evaluation Studio. Perform end-to-end tests to ensure the entire workflow—from data preparation through evaluation—operates as intended. Compare results with pre-migration outputs to confirm parity. Review documentation for completeness and accuracy.
