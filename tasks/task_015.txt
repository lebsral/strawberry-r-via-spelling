# Task ID: 15
# Title: Convert Existing Work and Datasets for Qwen3-4B Compatibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Update training data format, evaluation framework, and scripts to ensure compatibility with Qwen3-4B, including support for its tokenizer and thinking/non-thinking modes, while validating the integrity of the original experiment.
# Details:
This task involves converting all existing training datasets and evaluation frameworks to be compatible with the Qwen3-4B model. Key steps include: (1) Updating the training data format to align with Qwen3's tokenizer, ensuring that only English tokens are used as per the English-only subset; (2) Adapting the evaluation framework to support Qwen3-4B's unique features, such as thinking and non-thinking modes, and ensuring that all evaluation metrics and scripts are updated to reflect these capabilities; (3) Modifying all existing scripts and utilities to work seamlessly with the new tokenizer and model configuration; (4) Validating that the conversion process maintains the integrity of the original experiment's goals by comparing results before and after the migration. Special attention should be paid to the tokenizer's handling of English-only data and the model's reasoning modes, as these are critical for accurate and fair evaluation. Documentation should be updated to reflect all changes and provide clear guidance for future maintenance.

# Test Strategy:
To verify task completion, perform the following: (1) Run the updated training pipeline with the converted datasets and confirm that the model trains without errors; (2) Execute the evaluation framework with both thinking and non-thinking modes enabled, ensuring that all metrics are reported correctly and that the results are consistent with the original experiment; (3) Validate that all scripts and utilities function as expected with the new tokenizer and model configuration; (4) Compare the results of the original and converted pipelines to ensure that the integrity of the experiment is maintained; (5) Review updated documentation for accuracy and completeness. Automated tests should be added where possible to catch regressions in data processing, tokenization, and evaluation logic.
