# Task ID: 16
# Title: Update Environment Setup Scripts and Onboarding Docs for Qwen3-4B and Token Extraction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Revise all environment setup scripts and onboarding documentation to ensure compatibility with Qwen3-4B and the new English-only token extraction process, including updated installation instructions for transformers (>=4.51.0) and usage guidance for new token extraction scripts. Clearly distinguish between local (Mac/Apple Silicon) and cloud-based workflows.
# Details:
Review all existing environment setup scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Python setup files) and onboarding documentation to ensure they reference and support Qwen3-4B as the default model. Update instructions to include installation or upgrade steps for the transformers library (version 4.51.0 or higher), specifying any required flags or compatibility notes. 

Clearly document the split between local and cloud workflows:
- Local Mac (Apple Silicon) setup: Specify that only Mac-compatible packages should be installed. Explicitly note that Unsloth and xformers should NOT be installed locally. Include instructions to use `uv pip install ollama` for the Ollama Python API. Document using Hugging Face transformers for data preparation and tokenization.
- Cloud workflow: Clarify that all fine-tuning and Unsloth steps should be performed in cloud environments only (Google Colab or Lightning).

Add explicit instructions for using Ollama for local quantized inference and transformers for data preparation. Integrate clear, step-by-step guidance for using the new English-only token extraction scripts, including prerequisites, example commands, and troubleshooting tips. Reference the new workflow and model requirements throughout, ensuring that all documentation is consistent and unambiguous. Coordinate with the team to verify that all changes align with the latest project standards and dependencies established in Task 1.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that a new developer can follow the updated scripts and documentation to set up a working environment from scratch on both local Mac (Apple Silicon) and cloud environments. Test that developers can successfully install transformers (>=4.51.0) and Ollama locally, and run the new token extraction scripts with Qwen3-4B. Verify that the documentation clearly distinguishes which operations should be performed locally versus in the cloud. Confirm that all references to model requirements and workflows are accurate and that no outdated instructions remain. Test the local quantized inference workflow with Ollama. Solicit feedback from at least one team member not involved in the update to ensure clarity and completeness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update README and main onboarding documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Revise the main README.md and onboarding documentation to reflect current environment setup requirements for Qwen3-4B compatibility
### Details:
Review and update the main project documentation to ensure it accurately describes the current setup process, prerequisites, and environment configuration. Include clear sections on project purpose, high-level architecture, and getting started steps. Ensure all links are valid and documentation reflects the current state of the project.

Review and update the main project documentation to ensure it accurately describes the current setup process, prerequisites, and environment configuration. Include clear sections on project purpose, high-level architecture, and getting started steps. Ensure all links are valid and documentation reflects the current state of the project.

The documentation update should focus on creating a clear distinction between local (Mac/Apple Silicon) workflows and cloud workflows. This includes:

1. Review all existing documentation:
   - README.md in the project root
   - All onboarding documentation in the docs/ directory
   - Any setup scripts in the scripts/ directory

2. Create or update the following sections:
   - "Local (Mac/Apple Silicon) Workflow" - focusing on data preparation using transformers and inference with Ollama
   - "Cloud Workflow" - covering fine-tuning, Unsloth, xformers, and training processes
   - Add a comparison table or bullet list clearly showing which steps should be performed locally vs. in the cloud

3. Add explicit warnings about environment-specific dependencies:
   - Highlight that Unsloth and xformers are cloud-only and should never be installed locally
   - Provide clear installation instructions for local environment: `uv pip install ollama`, transformers for data preparation
   - Document cloud-specific setup for training with Qwen3-4B

4. Include practical examples:
   - Example commands for each environment
   - Troubleshooting section addressing common mistakes (especially attempting to install cloud-only packages locally)
   - References to the updated requirements from Task 16

5. Ensure consistency across all documentation:
   - Remove or update any outdated instructions
   - Verify that all documentation presents a unified approach to the local/cloud workflow split
   - Make the distinction between environments unambiguous for new users

## 2. Create Mac/Apple Silicon specific installation instructions [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop detailed installation instructions specifically for Mac users with Apple Silicon processors
### Details:
Document the specific steps, packages, and configurations needed for Apple Silicon Macs. Include troubleshooting for common issues, performance optimization tips, and any workarounds needed for compatibility. Test the instructions on an M1/M2 machine if possible to verify accuracy.

Document the specific steps, packages, and configurations needed for Apple Silicon Macs. Include troubleshooting for common issues, performance optimization tips, and any workarounds needed for compatibility. Test the instructions on an M1/M2 machine if possible to verify accuracy.

The Mac/Apple Silicon installation instructions should include:

1. Step-by-step environment setup:
   - Detailed instructions for using `uv` and virtualenv specifically on Apple Silicon
   - Clear guidance on installing core dependencies with proper architecture (arm64)
   - Instructions for Ollama installation for local quantized inference

2. Troubleshooting section for common Apple Silicon issues:
   - Solutions for torch/transformers installation errors (ensuring proper Apple Silicon wheels)
   - Fixing Homebrew and system dependency issues (libomp, openssl)
   - Resolving Jupyter/Matplotlib backend issues specific to macOS

3. Performance optimization tips:
   - Instructions for obtaining and using Apple Silicon-optimized wheels for torch/transformers
   - Guidance on avoiding Python under Rosetta 2 emulation
   - Best practices for using `uv` to create faster, reproducible environments
   - Tips for leveraging MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) acceleration

4. Verification steps:
   - A test script to verify torch, transformers, and Ollama imports
   - Commands to confirm correct Python architecture (arm64)
   - Instructions to print torch device info to confirm MPS availability
   - Simple inference test to verify end-to-end functionality

5. Reference table:
   - Common errors and their solutions
   - Required vs. optional dependencies
   - Version compatibility information

The documentation should be concise yet comprehensive, with clear distinction between required steps and optional optimizations. Consider creating a dedicated Mac-specific document or a clearly labeled section in the README.md.
