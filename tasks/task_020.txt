# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Current Data Structure and Generation Scripts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive audit of the existing data format, structure, and generation scripts to understand the current system before migration.
### Details:
Document the schema, fields, and relationships in the current custom format. Create a detailed inventory of all datasets currently in use, noting their specific characteristics, size, and purpose. Analyze the data generation scripts to understand how data is currently produced. Identify any custom extensions or modifications made to our format that will need special handling during conversion. Create a mapping document that shows how each current data field will map to Alpaca equivalents (instruction, input, output).

Document the schema, fields, and relationships in the current custom format. Create a detailed inventory of all datasets currently in use, noting their specific characteristics, size, and purpose. Analyze the data generation scripts to understand how data is currently produced. Identify any custom extensions or modifications made to our format that will need special handling during conversion. Create a mapping document that shows how each current data field will map to Alpaca equivalents (instruction, input, output).

The current data structure consists primarily of JSON files with two main formats:
1. Simple word lists in an "examples" array
2. Richer template-generated datasets with fields:
   - input: Contains the prompt/question
   - output: Contains the answer (usually a word)
   - template_category: Identifies template category (spelling_first, word_first, etc.)
   - template_style: Indicates style (simple, playful)
   - separator_style: Shows how letters are separated (space, comma, dash)
   - Additional specialized fields for certain question types

Dataset inventory:
- data/processed/:
  - test_char_questions_multi_token.json, val_char_questions_multi_token.json: Simple word lists
  - train_spelling.json, test_char_questions.json, val_char_questions.json: Larger structured files
  - english_tokens.json: Token validation reference
- data/raw/:
  - words_alpha.txt: Raw word list source

Key generation scripts:
- src/data/example_generator.py: Main generator using templates
- src/data/token_separator.py: Handles letter separation styles
- src/data/token_validator.py: Validates tokenizer compatibility
- src/data/data_loader.py: Loads and processes examples

Custom extensions requiring special handling:
- Template system defined in configs/templates/categories.json
- Multiple token separation styles
- Qwen3-4B compatibility validation

Mapping to Alpaca format:
- Current input → Alpaca instruction or input
- Current output → Alpaca output
- Metadata fields (template_category, template_style, etc.) can be preserved in extra fields
- Simple word lists need conversion to full Alpaca format

The data generation workflow uses templates defined in configuration files, generates examples via ExampleGenerator, and processes them through DataLoader for training.

Challenges include handling simple word lists and preserving metadata while conforming to Alpaca's core fields.

## 2. Design Alpaca-Compatible Schema and Validation Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Create a formal specification for our implementation of the Alpaca format, including handling of custom fields and metadata strategy.
### Details:
Define the core Alpaca fields (instruction, input, output) and how they will be populated. Design a strategy for handling any custom fields not natively supported in Alpaca (e.g., as metadata or by incorporating into core fields). Create JSON schema validation rules for the new format. Design a metadata approach that ensures compatibility with both Unsloth and Hugging Face. Document edge cases and special handling requirements identified during the audit phase. Create a schema visualization to help team members understand the new structure.

Define the core Alpaca fields (instruction, input, output) and how they will be populated. Design a strategy for handling any custom fields not natively supported in Alpaca (e.g., as metadata or by incorporating into core fields). Create JSON schema validation rules for the new format. Design a metadata approach that ensures compatibility with both Unsloth and Hugging Face. Document edge cases and special handling requirements identified during the audit phase. Create a schema visualization to help team members understand the new structure.

The Alpaca-Compatible Schema has been defined with the following specifications:

1. Core Fields:
   - instruction (string, required): Contains the main prompt/question for the LLM
   - input (string, optional): Additional context, can be empty string for tasks like spelling
   - output (string, required): The expected answer/completion from the model

2. Metadata Strategy:
   - All custom fields (template_category, template_style, separator_style, etc.) will be stored in a "meta" object
   - This approach ensures compatibility with both Hugging Face and Unsloth
   - Example structure:
     {
       "instruction": "The letters s p i t a l s spell what word?",
       "input": "",
       "output": "spitals",
       "meta": {
         "template_category": "spelling_first",
         "template_style": "simple",
         "separator_style": "space"
       }
     }

3. JSON Schema Validation Rules:
   - Created schema using JSON Schema draft-07
   - Required fields: instruction, output
   - input field is optional but should be present (empty string if no input)
   - meta field is optional and must be an object
   - additionalProperties set to false to enforce clean schema

4. Edge Cases & Special Handling:
   - Simple word lists must be converted to full Alpaca objects using default instruction templates
   - Validation will fail if instruction or output is missing
   - All core fields must be strings (meta is an object of strings)
   - Added support for legacy scripts that may need flattened metadata

5. Schema Visualization:
   - Created class diagram showing AlpacaExample and Meta classes and their relationships
   - This visualization will help team members understand the structure

Next steps include updating generation scripts to output this schema, implementing JSON schema validation in the pipeline, and testing with both Hugging Face and Unsloth to confirm compatibility.

Modify all data generation scripts to produce Alpaca format directly. Update template systems to align with the Alpaca structure. Implement proper escaping and formatting of special characters. Add validation checks during generation to ensure compliance with the Alpaca schema. Update any data augmentation processes to maintain compatibility with the new format. Create helper functions for common Alpaca format operations to ensure consistency across different generation scripts.

The Alpaca format requires each example to be a JSON object with three fields:
- `instruction`: The prompt or question for the model
- `input`: Additional context (can be empty string)
- `output`: The expected response

Implementation plan:
1. Update `src/data/example_generator.py`:
   - Modify `generate_example` to return Alpaca-formatted dictionaries
   - Convert template text with variables to the `instruction` field
   - Map additional context to the `input` field (empty string if not applicable)
   - Use the current `output` field for the Alpaca `output` field
   - Remove metadata fields (`template_category`, `template_style`, `separator_style`) from output
   - Update `generate_examples` to work with the new format
   - Refactor `save_examples` to write a flat list of Alpaca objects instead of nesting under `examples`

2. Update `src/data/data_loader.py`:
   - Modify loading logic to expect Alpaca format (list of dicts with instruction/input/output)
   - Remove any assumptions about the `examples` key or extra metadata fields

3. Add validation functions:
   - Create schema validation for Alpaca format
   - Add runtime checks to ensure all examples conform to the schema
   - Implement proper escaping for special characters

4. Handle potential challenges:
   - Ensure all templates can map to valid Alpaca triplets
   - Maintain backward compatibility where needed
   - Update any tests that expect the old format

5. Testing strategy:
   - Regenerate test datasets with updated scripts
   - Validate against Alpaca schema
   - Verify compatibility with downstream processes

   - Ensure all fields are strings and no extra fields are present
   - Integrate this validation into the data generation pipeline in `example_generator.py`
   - Run validation on all files in `data/processed/`

2. Edge Case & Data Integrity Checks:
   - Implement checks for identified edge cases (empty strings, special characters, long/short sequences)
   - Create logging and reporting for validation failures
   - Generate summary reports with counts, failures, and warnings

3. Sample Fine-Tuning Pipeline:
   - Develop `scripts/sample_finetune.py` for minimal testing with both Hugging Face Trainer and Unsloth
   - Use small models for local/CPU validation (`sshleifer/tiny-gpt2`) and Qwen3-4B/Unsloth for cloud
   - Verify Alpaca-formatted data loads and runs without errors
   - Document the testing process

4. Continuous Validation:
   - Create `scripts/validate_datasets.py` for batch validation after data generation
   - Consider future integration with pre-commit hooks or CI/CD

5. End-to-End Pipeline Testing:
   - Test the complete workflow: data generation → validation → sample fine-tuning
   - Document issues, fixes, and required changes

Key files to be created or modified:
- `src/data/validate_alpaca_schema.py` (new)
- `src/data/example_generator.py` (update)
- `scripts/validate_datasets.py` (new)
- `scripts/sample_finetune.py` (new)

Ensure compatibility with the Qwen3-4B English token subset (from Tasks #17-19). Test integration with all existing model architectures. Implement any necessary changes to tokenization or preprocessing steps. Update configuration files and parameters to reflect the new data format.

The training and evaluation pipelines must be updated to work with the new Alpaca-format data structure, with special attention to the explicit 'word' field that will be used for validation purposes. All pipelines should integrate the AlpacaSchemaValidator and token set validators to perform comprehensive checks on datasets before any training or evaluation begins. This integration ensures data quality and consistency throughout the pipeline.

All data loading, batching, and preprocessing components need to be modified to expect the new format and validation fields. Documentation and code comments should reference the new validation scripts (scripts/validate_datasets.py and src/data/validate_alpaca_schema.py) to guide users and developers. CLI usage examples for validation should be added to the documentation to facilitate easy verification of datasets.

The updated pipelines should reference docs/validation.md and docs/data_format.md for comprehensive details on the validation process and data format specifications. These references should be included in both code comments and user-facing documentation to ensure clarity and consistency in implementation.
