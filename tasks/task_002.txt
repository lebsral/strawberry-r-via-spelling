# Task ID: 2
# Title: Token Extraction from GPT-2 Vocabulary
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract all multi-character, letter-based tokens from the GPT-2 tokenizer vocabulary and save them to a JSON file.
# Details:
1. Load the GPT-2 tokenizer from Hugging Face
2. Extract all tokens from the vocabulary
3. Filter tokens to include only multi-character, letter-based tokens
4. Save the filtered token list to a JSON file with the structure specified in the PRD
5. Create a Jupyter notebook to verify token selection
6. Analyze token frequency and length distribution

This task has been broken down into three parallelizable subtasks that can be worked on independently:
- Script Writing: Implementing the token extraction logic
- Validation & Testing: Ensuring the extracted tokens meet requirements
- Documentation: Creating clear documentation for the process and results

Implementation:
```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer
import json
import re

def extract_tokens():
    # Load tokenizer
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

    # Extract and filter tokens
    filtered_tokens = []
    for token_id, token_text in tokenizer.get_vocab().items():
        # Remove special tokens and decode byte tokens
        decoded_token = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string([token_text])

        # Filter for multi-character letter-based tokens
        if len(decoded_token) > 1 and re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z]+$', decoded_token):
            filtered_tokens.append({
                "token": decoded_token,
                "token_id": token_id,
                "char_length": len(decoded_token)
            })

    # Save to file
    with open("gpt2_letter_tokens.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump({"tokens": filtered_tokens}, f, indent=2)

    return filtered_tokens

tokens = extract_tokens()
print(f"Extracted {len(tokens)} multi-character letter-based tokens")
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify JSON file is successfully created
2. Confirm file contains at least 5,000 tokens
3. Randomly sample tokens to confirm they are multi-character and letter-based
4. Verify no special tokens (like <|endoftext|>) are included
5. Create visualizations of token length distribution
6. Commit token extraction script and results
